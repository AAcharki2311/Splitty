# Meeting

#### Meeting Organization

Mark: Pass

Feedback: There was a chair (Thijmen) and a minute taker (Giulia).

#### Agenda 

Mark: Very good

Feedback: The agenda was added to the repository on time and had clear individual points.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Very good

Feedback: The notes contain agreements and assigned people to tasks. The notes are clear and concise.


#### Chair performance

Mark: Very good

Feedback: The chair lead the discussion and made sure that all of the topics from the agenda were covered.


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Good

Feedback: The general atmosphere was alright, friendly tone and constructive suggestions. One thing that I would recommend for further meetings is having the laptops closed (if you're not the chair), as I noticed that they can be a bit distracting.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Good

Feedback: The team has a working prototype that works well, and is on track to have a working application until the end of the project. There are still some features left to implement, but I am confident you will tackle them succesfully.

#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: During the meeting, only some students discussed the actions of the previous two weeks. It seems that work could be distributed a bit more equally.
