# Meeting

#### Meeting Organization

Mark: Pass

Feedback: The meeting had a chair and a minute taker.


#### Agenda 

Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: 
- Tops: Agenda was submitted in time.
- Tips: Don't just upload the template agenda. The agenda needs to be filled with action points you want to talk during the TA meeting. I saw some small changes in the template but those are not enough. The agenda should be a mini assignment you have to do every week and you should not treat it superficially. This is the second week when this happens so please make sure that you take my feedback into consideration.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: 
- Tops: The notes were merged in time and the notes are clear. I like that you also included action points and agreement from the meeting.
- Tips: Make sure that you follow the md format. You can also add more concrete agreements from the meeting and which people are assigned to which tasks.


#### Chair performance

Mark: Good

Feedback: 
- Tops: You covered most topics from the agenda. You listened to everyone's input and tried to give everyone a chance to talk. Nice job! 
- Tips: The chair should start the meeting by letting everyone say what they did in the previous week. At the feedback round you can just name everyone one by one so everyone talks:) 


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Good

Feedback: 
- Tops: The team took ownership of the meeting, making the atmosphere constructive. Almost everyone was actively contributing with ideas and also listening to others. Good job! 
- Tips: Make sure that everyone talks and is active during the meeting. I saw an improvement from last week tho:) 


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: 
- Tops: The team presented the current state of the application. The progress is fine for the first week of coding.
- Tips: As soon as you have some scenes ready or some interesting functionality make sure that you show it to me during the meeting. Make sure that this week you start working on more useful features.


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: 
- Tops: I like that you mentioned what you did in the previous week. Almost everyone finished their tasks from the previous week. For now it seems like the contribution is somewhat equal. Make sure that you explain what you did in the previous week in each meeting.
- Tips: Make sure that everyone contributes somewhat equally. You don't need to count lines, but remember that you are a team and you should make sure that everyone contributes to the project.
